## âœ… Example Formatting Guidelines

When documenting validation rules:

* Use **Rule Name** in `backticks`
* Provide the **formula** in a fenced code block ( \`\`\` )
* Write the **Error Message** in a fenced code block ( \`\`\` )
* Specify the **Error Location** clearly

This structure makes the validation rules easy to read and replicate.
